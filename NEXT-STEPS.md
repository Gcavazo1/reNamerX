   - Upload the source code (excluding build artifacts and node_modules)
   - Include the updated documentation (README.md, INSTALL.md, USAGE.md)

3. **Create a Release**:
   - Create a new release in GitHub with tag `v1.0.0`
   - Upload the build artifacts to the release
   - Include release notes highlighting features and known issues

## Distribution Channels

Consider the following distribution channels for your application:

1. **GitHub Releases**:
   - The primary distribution channel for open-source projects
   - Enables easy versioning and release notes
