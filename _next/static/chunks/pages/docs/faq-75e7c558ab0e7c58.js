It offers a modern interface with advanced features for efficiently renaming multiple files using various rules and patterns.\n\n### Which operating systems does reNamerX support?\n\nCurrently, reNamerX is available for Windows 10 and Windows 11 (64-bit). Support for macOS and Linux is planned for future releases.\n\n### Is reNamerX free to use?\n\nYes, reNamerX is free software released under the MIT License. You can use it for both personal and commercial purposes without cost.\n\n### Where can I download reNamerX?\n\nYou can download reNamerX from the [download page](/download) on this website or from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Gcavazo1/reNamerX/releases).\n\n### How do I report bugs or request features?\n\nYou can report bugs or request features by opening an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Gcavazo1/reNamerX/issues). Please check existing issues first to avoid duplicates.\n\n## Installation & Updates\n\n### Do I need to install any prerequisites?\n\nNo, reNamerX is self-contained and doesn't require any additional software to be installed.\n\n### Can I use reNamerX without installation?\n\nYes, we provide a portable version that can be run without installation. Download the portable ZIP file from our download page and extract it to any location.\n\n### How do I update reNamerX?\n\nWhen a new version is released, you can:\n1. Download the latest installer from our website\n2. Run the installer, which will automatically update your existing installation\n3. Your settings and presets will be preserved\n\n### Will reNamerX automatically check for updates?\n\nCurrently, reNamerX doesn't automatically check for updates. We're planning to add this feature in a future release.\n\n## Usage Questions\n\n### How many files can reNamerX process at once?\n\nreNamerX can handle hundreds or even thousands of files at once, depending on your system's memory. For very large batches (10,000+ files), we recommend processing them in smaller groups for better performance.\n\n### Can I undo renaming operations?\n\nYes, reNamerX includes a multi-level undo system. You can undo any batch rename operation by pressing `Ctrl+Z` or clicking the Undo button.\n\n### Can I rename files across multiple folders?\n\nCurrently, reNamerX processes files within a single folder at a time. Support for processing files across multiple folders simultaneously is planned for a future release.\n\n### Does reNamerX support regular expressions?\n\nYes, reNamerX fully supports regular expressions (regex) for advanced pattern matching and replacement. Enable the regex option in the Replace Text rule to use this feature.\n\n### Can I save my frequently used renaming patterns?\n\nYes, you can save your renaming configurations as presets. Configure your rules, click \"Save Preset\" or press `Ctrl+Alt+S`, and give your preset a name. You can later load these presets from the Presets menu.\n\n### Can reNamerX rename files based on their metadata?\n\nYes, reNamerX can rename files based on date/time metadata (creation date, modification date). Support for additional metadata (EXIF, ID3, etc.) is planned for future releases.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Why can't I rename some files?\n\nThere could be several reasons:\n1. The files might be in use by another application\n2. You might not have permission to modify the files\n3. The target filename already exists\n4. The new filename contains invalid characters\n\nCheck the application's status messages for specific error information.\n\n### How do I fix \"Access Denied\" errors?\n\n\"Access Denied\" errors typically occur when:\n1. The file is open in another application - close the application and try again\n2. You don't have permission to modify the file - run reNamerX as administrator\n3. The file is in a protected system folder - avoid renaming system files\n\n### Why does the preview show some filenames in red?\n\nFilenames shown in red in the preview indicate potential conflicts or errors. This typically happens when:\n1. The resulting filename would be invalid\n2. Multiple files would end up with the same name\n3. The new name contains invalid characters\n\nModify your renaming rules to resolve these issues before applying.\n\n### I can't see all my files after adding a folder. Why?\n\nBy default, reNamerX shows all files in the selected folder. If you're not seeing some files:\n1. Check if you have an active filter in the search box\n2. Verify that you're looking in the correct folder\n3. Ensure you haven't accidentally enabled a file type filter\n\n### Why are my presets missing after updating?\n\nIn most cases, presets are preserved when updating reNamerX. If your presets are missing:\n1. Check if you installed to a different location than before\n2. Look in the backup folder (reNamerX creates backups of settings before updates)\n3. If you can't recover them, consider exporting presets to files regularly as a backup\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### How do I use capture groups in regex replacements?\n\nWhen using regex with capture groups:\n1. Enable the \"Use regex\" option in the Replace Text rule\n2. Create capture groups in your pattern using parentheses: `(group1)(group2)`\n3. Reference captured groups in your replacement text using `$1`, `$2`, etc.\n\nExample: To swap two words, use pattern `(\\w+)_(\\w+)` and replacement `$2_$1`\n\n### Can I combine multiple renaming rules?\n\nYes, reNamerX lets you apply multiple rules in sequence. Each rule takes the output of the previous rule as its input. Add multiple rules in the rules panel and they will be processed in order from top to bottom.\n\n### Can I export/import presets between computers?\n\nYes, you can export presets to files and import them on another computer:\n1. From the Presets menu, select \"Manage Presets\"\n2. Select the presets you want to export\n3. Click \"Export\" and choose a location\n4. On the other computer, open the Manage Presets dialog and click \"Import\"\n\n### Is there a command-line interface for reNamerX?\n\nCurrently, reNamerX doesn't have a command-line interface. We're considering adding this feature in a future version to support automation and scripting."})}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"mt-8 flex justify-between",children:[(0,s.jsxs)("a",{href:"/docs/usage-guide",className:"inline-flex items-center text-gray-400 hover:text-primary",children:[(0,s.jsx)("svg",{className:"w-5 h-5 mr-2",fill:"none",stroke:"currentColor",viewBox:"0 0 24 24",xmlns:"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg",children:(0,s.jsx)("path",{strokeLinecap:"round",strokeLinejoin:"round",strokeWidth:2,d:"M15 19l-7-7 7-7"})}),"Usage Guide"]}),(0,s.jsxs)("a",{href:"/docs/troubleshooting",className:"inline-flex items-center text-gray-400 hover:text-primary",children:["Troubleshooting",(0,s.jsx)("svg",{className:"w-5 h-5 ml-2",fill:"none",stroke:"currentColor",viewBox:"0 0 24 24",xmlns:"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg",children:(0,s.jsx)("path",{strokeLinecap:"round",strokeLinejoin:"round",strokeWidth:2,d:"M9 5l7 7-7 7"})})]})]})]})]})})]})})},8916:(e,n,r)=>{(window.__NEXT_P=window.__NEXT_P||[]).push(["/docs/faq",function(){return r(4094)}])}},e=>{var n=n=>e(e.s=n);e.O(0,[8,417,810,636,593,792],()=>n(8916)),_N_E=e.O()}]);
