To complete the website setup, you should add a favicon.ico file to this directory.

You can:
1. Convert the app icon from reNamerX-master/src/assets/renamerx_favicon_image.png to .ico format
2. Use an online converter or Photoshop to create an .ico file
3. Place the generated favicon.ico file directly in this public directory

The website is already configured to use /favicon.ico in the HTML head.
